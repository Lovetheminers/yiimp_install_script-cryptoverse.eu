If you are issue after installation (nginx,mariadb... not found), use this script : bash install-debug.sh (watch the log during installation)


###### :bangbang: **YOU MUST UPDATE THE FOLLOWING FILES :**

- **/etc/yiimp/keys.php :** update with secrect keys from the exchanges (not mandatory)
- **If you want change 'AdminPanel' to access Panel Admin :** Edit this file "/var/web/yaamp/modules/site/SiteController.php" and Line 11 => change 'AdminPanel'


###### :bangbang: **IMPORTANT** : 

- The configuration of yiimp and coin require a minimum of knowledge in linux
- Your mysql information (login/Password) is saved in **~/.my.cnf**

***********************************

###### This script has an interactive beginning and will ask for the following information :

- Are you using a subdomain (mypoolx11.crypto.com)
- Enter support email
- Set stratum to AutoExchange
- Your Public IP for admin access (Put your PERSONNAL IP, NOT IP of your VPS)
- Install Fail2ban
- Install UFW and configure ports
- Install LetsEncrypt SSL

***********************************

**This install script will get you 95% ready to go with yiimp. There are a few things you need to do after the main install is finished.**

While I did add some server security to the script, it is every server owners responsibility to fully secure their own servers. After the installation you will still need to customize your serverconfig.php file to your liking, add your API keys, and build/add your coins to the control panel. 

There will be several wallets already in yiimp. These have nothing to do with the installation script and are from the database import from the yiimp github.
